# Conclusion

Damn this was a little bit harder after my initial thoughts. After getting the right hang of the syntax for a joined table and the corresponding foreign keys, it was a lot of fun when it finally "clicked" and everything worked. I hope this project helped me get a better hands on experience with Rails asscoiations. 
Also scopes are pretty amazing

Try it out by running

` rails s `

and go to 

` localhost:3000`
